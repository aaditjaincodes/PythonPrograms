'''
Given the height (A) and weight (B) of a person as input in centimetres and kilograms.

Find the BMI of that person and the classification of the user based on their BMI.

Print Underweight if BMI < 18.5
Print Normal weight if BMI lies in the range [18.5, 24.9]
Print Overweight if BMI lies in the range (24.9, 29.9]
Print Obese if BMI is greater than 29.9
If x is the weight in kilograms and y is the height in metres.

Then, BMI is calculated as x/(y*y).

Problem Constraints -

1 <= A <= 180

1 <= B <= 120

Input Format -

The first line contains the height of the person in centimetres.

The second line of the input contains the weight of the person in kilograms.

Output Format -

The first line of the output contains the classification of a person based on the BMI value.

The second line of the output contains the BMI value of the person.

Sample Input -

Input 1:

101
29
Input 2:

129
31
Sample Output -

Output 1:

Overweight
28.4
Output 2:

Normal
18.6
