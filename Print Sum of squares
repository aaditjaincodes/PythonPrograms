'''
Given an integer n, write a program to print the sum of squares of first n natural numbers in integer format.

Note1:

The formula for the sum of squares of first n natural numbers is: n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Note2:

You need not take input in this problem, only implement the function provided.

Problem Constraints:

1 <= N <= 100
Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases.
For each testcase there will be a single line of input with an integer representing n for that testcase.
Output Format:

Sum of squares of n natural numbers in integer format
Sample Input:

1
6
Sample Output:

91
Sample explanation:

According to the formula sum of first 6 natural numbers is 6*(6+1)(12+1)/6=91
