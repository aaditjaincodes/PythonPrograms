'''
Write a function to calculate and return the area of a circle by using the radius of the circle given as a parameter.

Notes:

Round up the area to 2 decimal places. You can use the round() function.
Use pi as 3.14159.
You need not take input in this problem, you need to only implement the function provided.
Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. 
For each test case there will be one line of input in integer format representing radius.
Output Format:

Area in float format rounded upto 2 decimal places for each testcase.
Sample Input:

1  
5
Sample Output:

78.54
Sample explanation:

The area for circle with radius 5cm is 3.14159 x (5 x 5) = 78.53975 cm2

After rounding by 2 digits, it becomes 78.54 cm2
'''

def circle_area(r):
    ans=None
    '''input: r = A numerical value as radius
       output: Return the area of circle as ans upto 2 decimal places'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    ans=3.14159*r*r
    return round(ans,2)
